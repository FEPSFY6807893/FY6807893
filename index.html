      <p> 
      This paper aims to be a description on the past, present and future of biomechanics.  From discussing the fundamentals of moving the body to the advancements made towards prosthetic limbs. The foundations of this research date all the way back to 1700 BC around Ancient Egypt time with the discovery of human anatomy which was later researched more in depth in the 19th century.  The paper also discusses how the World Wars changed biomechanics for the better and the beginning of mass-producing prosthetic limbs.  Finally, it discusses the future and the next steps towards making biomechanics the fundamentals of health care.

      <h3 id="Introduction"> Introduction </h3>
      <p>
   Since the dawn of humanity two things have always been compared brain and brawn. A battle of the mind usually consists of civilised arguments and a lot of condescending laughter however a battle of strength usually results in multiple serious injuries so in order to combat this, constant developments were made in the medical field which eventually led us to creating biomechanics.  ‘Biomechanics is the study of forces acting on and generated within the body and of the effects of these forces on the tissues, fluids, or materials used for diagnosis, treatment, or research purposes.’ <a href="#1"> (Workplace, N.R.C. (US) and I. of M. (US) P. on M.D. and the (2001).).</a>  In my project I will be explaining the past and present of biomechanics and speculating on the future of it. 
      <p>
      <h3 id="Past"> Past</h3>
  
      <p> 
        Biomechanics research ranges back to 1700 – 1600 BC with research into human anatomy with the traces found in Ancient Egypt but the discovery of human bones, joint and muscles is thanks to Leonardo da Vinci who was one of the first people to dissect a human being.  With this understanding many scientists where able to start understanding the mechanics and movement of the human body better.  One scientist in particular named Giovanni Alfonso Borelli (1608 – 1679) started to apply newtons laws of motion to the joints in our bodies hence deepening our understanding of our bone structure.  The next major discovery takes place in the 19th century where we learn that humans have about 200 bones, 320 skeletal muscles and quite a few joints.  As well as that Wilhelm and Eduard Weber established that the centre of mass in a human body is about 56.7% of their height from the ground while in a standing position.  They also made two more discoveries the first being that the centre of gravity lowers with increasing movement speed, the second was that the time when both feet touch the ground decreases with increasing walking speed and the final discovery was that during movement the foot on the ground produces a fixation point which allows an inverted pendulum movement to the lower hip in other words its explaining how walking actually takes place.<a href="#2">(Manalova, A.(2018).).</a>
   
      <h3 id="Present">Present </h3>

    Biomechanics only truly started taking off in the 20th century and because of this many subsections of the subject were derived such as cardiovascular, cell, human movement (orthopaedic), occupational and sport biomechanics<a href="#3">  Aruin, A. (2019).  [3]. </a> This is great but why did biomechanics start developing all of a sudden?  Following the first world war the United States implemented it as a university program as a way of giving back to the soldiers who fought.  At this point in time prosthetics (An artificial body part) was not classified as a medical emergency so the reigns of the project were left to engineers and using prior discoveries as a foundation soon the first functioning prosthetic limbs were created. This was known as the P-K arm and it was created in 1920 – 1925, this arm allowed the user to grip items with the fingers using steel springs and a lever placed above the wrist which can be operated by their other hand. This revolutionary creation would have been fine to be left alone but the engineers and now doctors alike became obsessed with creating a prosthetic limb that would function near enough identically to the regular arm.  So by the time World War 2 ended a prosthetic arm was created that uses the foot instead of the other arm.  The arm was powered by a battery driven electric motor with switches on the foot, this intern made the limb much easier to use.  However not everything is a positive due to the extensive resources used it takes a long time to build which means the waiting time is even longer so although the aspect of the limbs was improving the distribution was <a href="#4"> (not. collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk. (n.d.). ‘P & K’ artificial left arm, Belfast, Northern Ireland, (2012). </a>
      </p>
  <p>
    On the other side of the body we have legs so naturally prosthetic legs were also created however the legs on the other hand date back to around 300 BC in the ancient Rome period.  This limb was known as the Capua leg and was made of bronze and hollowed out via wood and kept together with leather straps.<a href="#5"> NIH MedlinePlus Magazine. (n.d.) (2020). </a> Over time peg legs have been improving with more light weight materials for example in 1872 William Minto Hawkins created the idea of a peg leg stating that it is an improvement in <a href="#6">artificial legs americanhistory.si.edu. (n.d.). (2021).</a>  This creation was used after World War 1 similarly to the functioning prosthetic arm.  Although the process was slower a functioning prosthetic leg was created around the 1970’s when carbon fibre was being implemented into prosthetics as a whole.  this allowed a more light weight feel to the leg as well as that it allowed the doctors and engineers to created a working knee joint to give a more realistic feel to it.  However just like the arms the legs are very expensive ranging from 3500 to 90000 USD <a href="#7">digital.lib.ecu.edu. (n.d.). (2019) </a>.  Although the pricing are very high and costly research is still being done to increase the depths of prosthetics as a whole.  
  </p>
  
        <h3 id="Future"> Future </h3>
      <p> 
Currently scientists are working on the concept of prosthetic organs which if successful could be able to replace crucial organs like the heart or the liver, this concept is rumoured to be between 20 to 30 years away meaning organ donors will be a thing of the past <a href="#7">  Fortune Well. (n.d.). (2023). </a>.  When the prosthetic organs are in full working condition, the next question is what are the next steps going from here.  Now this is all speculation backed up with the slimmest scientific proof because a lot of the ideas hinge on the development of resources as a whole.  One way scientist want to develop biomechanics is by linking AI to prosthetic limbs, this will allow the limbs to become more personalized to the user, this would work by collecting data on the individual then implementing training programs so the AI adapts to it.  Thought this sounds great on paper there are also a few negatives due to AI being a relatively new field of research the AI might breach safety or privacy protocols. Even with the negatives taken into account scientists are certain that the use of AI will revolutionize biomechanics forever. <a href="#8">  Frąckiewicz, M. (2023)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
    In conclusion the development of biomechanics is not only revolutionary in the medical field but also in everyday living.  Biomechanics has improved our understanding of our bodies and allowed is to create ways of healing once thought of as impossible and the concept will only grow in time it could pave the path of medical research in the future.
